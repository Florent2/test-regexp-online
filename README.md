Test your Regular Expression online
===================================

A toy project I made to learn a bit more about JavaScript and jQuery.

[Demo page](http://florent2.github.com/test-regexp-online/)

TODO:

* check HTML validity...

* add tests (with http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/ ?)

* check other online regular expression testers to see if other features can be useful

* more work needed to support the g flag to correctly highlight all matched strings
* to support the m flag I would need the user to be able to enter characters like \n

* fix spans showing: initially they are displayed below the input field

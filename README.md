Test your Regular Expression online
===================================

A toy project I made to learn a bit more about JavaScript and jQuery.

[Demo page](http://florent2.github.com/test-regexp-online/)

TODO:

* add JavaScript regular expression reference
  * add missing sections
    * check everything works for JavaScript
  * change disposition of span results (below inputs)
  
* improve design
* check HTML validity...

* add tests (with http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/ ?)

* add possibility to get a permalink of a given regexp and examples & counterexamples
  * add title
  * add examples
* check other online regular expression testers to see if other features can be useful
  * http://www.ninjavspenguin.com/regexp.html#groups_and_ranges

* more work needed to support the g flag to correctly highlight all matched strings
* to support the m flag I would need the user to be able to enter characters like \n

* allow example or counter example deletion
* fix spans showing: initially they are displayed below the input field
* use HTML5 tags

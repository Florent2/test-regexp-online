Test your Regular Expression online
===================================

A toy project I made to learn a bit more about JavaScript and jQuery.

TODO:
* check whether better selection rules can be used
* make sure matched string hightligthing
* improve design
* allow /i, /g... options
* allow example or counter example deletion
* fix spans showing: initially they are displayed below the input field
* update_input should take the regexp value as a parameter
* check other online regular expression testers to see if other features can be useful
* add JavaScript regular expression reference
* add tests (with http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/ ?)
* check if it's working with special characters
* display alert when regular expression is not valid

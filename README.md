Test your Regular Expression online
===================================

A toy project I made to learn a bit more about JavaScript and jQuery.

[Demo page](http://florent2.github.com/test-regexp-online/)

TODO:

* check HTML validity...

* add tests (with http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/, http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/wiki/GettingStarted ?)

* add permalink examples for the references

* more work needed to support the g flag to correctly highlight all matched strings
* to support the m flag I would need the user to be able to enter characters like \n, ie use textarea?

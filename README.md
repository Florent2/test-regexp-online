Test your Regular Expression online
===================================

A toy project I made to learn a bit more about JavaScript and jQuery.

[Demo page](http://florent2.github.com/test-regexp-online/)

TODO:

* display alert when regular expression is not valid

* add JavaScript regular expression reference
* improve design
* check HTML validity...

* check other online regular expression testers to see if other features can be useful

* add tests (with http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/ ?)
* check if it's working with special characters / allow to input special characters like \n

* more work needed to support the g flag to correctly highlight all matched strings

* allow example or counter example deletion
* fix spans showing: initially they are displayed below the input field
* use HTML5 tags
